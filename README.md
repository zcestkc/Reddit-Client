<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

I created a sneaker launch website to demonstrate my ability to use React, React-Router and Bootstrap. I have previously used react router in tutorials and I wanted to try it myself and put my own spin on it.

Additionally, I created a form with validation to cement my knowledge of React and I used an external library to assist me with it. Whilst, aslo using AWS to deploy and host the site.

The website is responsive to all screen sizes and has 90+ score on all metrics of the Google Chrome Lighthouse test.

### Built With

- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- [AWS Amplify](https://aws.com)
- HTML/CSS/JS

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Features

- Landing and Heritage page which implements Bootstrap 4 for styling
- Preorder form with validation
- Web app is responsive to all screen sizes

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## React

- Implemented the use of React hooks through the project
- Utilised useEffect to create the countdown timer in the footer
- Applied .map() to create all the image components
- Leverage external libraries to create the form
- Used React Router to switch between pages

<!-- Future Improvements -->

## Bootstrap

- Applied the latest version of Bootstrap to make the website aesthetic and modern
- Leverage the Bootstrap built in Modal and extended it further by using useEffect to turn it into a pop up
- Took advantage of the responsive navbar and added custom CSS to change the default styling.
