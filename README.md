<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

I created a reddit client website to demonstrate my ability to use React, React-Router and Redux. I have previously used react router in tutorials and I wanted to try it myself and put my own spin on it.

The website is responsive to all screen sizes.

### Built With

- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
- HTML/CSS/JS

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Features

- Search bar to display specified posts
- Subreddit menu to browse different topics
- Web app is responsive to all screen sizes

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## React

- Implemented the use of React hooks through the project
- Utilised useEffect to create the countdown timer in the footer
- Applied .map() to create all the image components
- Leverage external libraries to create the form
- Used React Router to switch between pages

<!-- Future Improvements -->

## Redux

- Applied the latest version of Bootstrap to make the website aesthetic and modern
- Leverage the Bootstrap built in Modal and extended it further by using useEffect to turn it into a pop up
- Took advantage of the responsive navbar and added custom CSS to change the default styling.

## Bluehost

- Deployed my site online using Bluehost for the first time
- Connected the site to an actual domain, familarised myself with cPanel functionalities and web hosting

## SEO

Was able to obtain a high score for the Google Lighthouse report, gaining an average of 96
